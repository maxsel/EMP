# SQL task: 

Here is the task:
> Order employees by number of ALL subordinates
> (not only direct reports!).

Two files are solutions:
  - ```TREE.sql``` (very rough and unbeautiful);
  - ```SOLUTION.sql``` - that's the right solution.

Use export.sql to create ```EMP``` table and load init data.

Another scripts are just sketches and ideas and don't deserve any interest.
